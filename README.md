This is a mod for Hollow Knight Randomizer that adds pins to the map showing
the location of the various checks. It's trainning wheels for beginners to
learn how to play Hollow Knight Randomizer.

## Features

* Talking to Elderbug 3 times activates the mod and gives you all maps
  (including the Collector's map if grubs are non-randomized) and the compass
  charm.
* The map will contain pins indicating which checks are currently reachable.
* The map will show a list of areas and the number of checks available in each
  area.

## How to install

1. Make sure `ModCommon.dll` and `RandomizerMod3.0.dll` are already installed
   in your Hollow Knight Mod Folder. If they're not installed, easiest way to
   install them is to [use the Hollow Knight Mod Installer](https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknight/mods/9).
2. Download [the latest release of `RandoMapMod.dll`](https://github.com/NebuPookins/HollowKnight.RandoMapMod/releases/).
3. Copy `RandoMapMod.dll` to your Hollow Knight mod folder (for example
   `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hollow Knight\hollow_knight_Data\Managed\Mods`).
4. Start a new game.
5. Talk to Elderbug 3 times.

## How it works

There are five different types of pins:

* **Small Dark (?) Pins** indicate item locations that are considered to be not
  reachable based on the allowed-skip settings in the randomizer. It's possible
  they are still obtainable through sequence breaks.
* **Big Red (?) Pins** indicate item locations that are currently considered
  reachable, and one of these will contain the progression you are looking for
  if you are stuck.
* **Yellow (!) Pins** indicate item locations that are currently considered
  reachable but still require some form of prerequisite to obtain. For example,
  Grubs for Grubfather or Essence for Seer.
* **Small Dark ($) Pins** indicate shop locations that are currently considered
  not reacehable.
* **Big Green ($) Pins** indicate shop locations that are currently in
  reachable, as a reminder to the player that the shop may still have items for
  sale they may need.
